# Tic Tac Toe Game in Python
This is a Tic Tac Toe game built in Python. It's a simple console-based game where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid until one player gets three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or all spaces are filled up, resulting in a tie.

The game will prompt you to enter the names of the two players.
The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol, and the second player will be assigned the 'O' symbol.
Players take turns entering the row and column numbers of the space they want to mark.
